# This is the very first code I wrote in Python

- My TA, Ben Hill, helped me a lot in completing this lab and clarifying some concepts.
- This samll program is a simple point of sale restaurant system which displays a welcome message with the list of available menu to the user
- The program also tell the user how to exit
- It then ask the user what they would like to order from the menu list and prompts for input
- When a user enters an item, the program will print an acknowledgment of the input
- The program then matches the input and the menu list and print the ordered item with the description of how mant times that particular item is ordered.
- If the item ordered doesn't match the program will print a message desciption
- This program will quit asking for orders when the user enters the word "quit"
